Software development process:

programming is a process of problem solving.
methodologies

1. problem specification
2. analyze the problem
3. design a solution
4. code the solution
5. implement the code
6. test and debug
7. desired results

Questions:
what kind of data will be available for input?
what type of values will be in each of the identified data items?
what is the domain(range of the values) for each input item?
will the user of the program be inputting values?
if the problem solution is to be used with multiple data sets, are there any data items that stay the same, or remain constant, with each set?


How the input data items would be determined:

identifier
data item
type
domain of values for each item

Design a solution:
methods, 
divide and conquerer method
top-down design

Object-oriented approach
focus is on determining the data characteristics and the methods or behaviors that operate on the data.
